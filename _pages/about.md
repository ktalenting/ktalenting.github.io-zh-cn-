# About Me 
I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Planning at University of Waterloo. My recent work focues on several research projects, including the rural-to-urban resettlement process in China, rural resilience and sustainability, as well as urban form transformation in China based on space syntax theory and GIS-based analytical appraoches. 

My research interests include: Rural-to-urban resettlement and urbanization in China; Social justice and spatial inequality; Critical urban studies; Urban form and land use planning; urban morphology; GIS-based decision making and spatial analysis; Multiple Criteria Decision Making; Space syntax; Gentrification, conservation and redevelopment.
